## My process

I recreated the design over a few hours trying to use semantic HTML5 markup, CSS and Flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Having previously made small projects using CSS grid, this was an attempt using flexbox.  I enjoyed using it and found it very useful for smaller projects such as this one.

### Continued development

I want to continue to develop my design skills as I feel this is my weakness.  I am more comfortable using Javascript and making things work than I am making thinks look good.  I would like to try to use Bootstrap or Sass in a future project.
